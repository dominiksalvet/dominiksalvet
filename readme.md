Hello! :wave: I am Dominik. When I was 14 years old, I discovered redstone circuits in Minecraft. Two years later, I built **my first working processor** in that game. This is how I have come to my true life passion – processor design. :purple_heart: Most of my projects are available here on GitHub or on **my other profiles** stated below. I deliver quality. :gem:
