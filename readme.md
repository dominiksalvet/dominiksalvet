# Hello, I am Dominik.

In 2011, I discovered redstone circuits in Minecraft. Two years later, I built **my first working processor** in that game. I quickly realized that I had found something invaluable in my life. Ever since then, processor design has been my life passion. :purple_heart: Are you curious about the **results**? They are right in front of your eyes, here on GitHub, or on my other profiles stated below.
