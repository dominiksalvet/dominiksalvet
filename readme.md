# Hello, I am Dominik.

In 2011, I came across redstone circuits in Minecraft. Two years later, I built **my first working processor** there. I quickly realized that I had found something invaluable, and processor design has become my life passion. ðŸ’œ

Despite the strong words, I am still learning a lot of knowledge about processors and their design, and I am glad for such opportunities. If you want to see the **bits created during my journey**, look around or visit my other profiles. ðŸš€
