# Hello, I am Dominik.

In 2011, I came by redstone circuits in Minecraft. Two years later, I built **my first working processor** in that game. I quickly realized that I had found something invaluable in my life. Ever since then, processor design has been my life passion. :purple_heart:

Despite the strong words, I have been frequently finding myself lacking the required knowledge from various processor design areas. It is the **opportunity to grow**, and I am trying to see it that way. Practice makes perfect. :rocket:

If you are interested in **bits created during my journey**, look around or visit my other profiles. :ok_hand:
