Hi, I am Dominik. When I was 14 years old, I discovered redstone circuits in Minecraft. Two years later, I created my first working processor in that game. This is how I have come to my life's passion â€“ processor design. Most of my projects are available here on GitHub, or on my other profiles stated below. I deliver quality.
